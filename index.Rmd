## Instructions
This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

##App Documentary

###Context
In the context of multivariate regression, the so-called Simpson's Paradox points out, that unadjusted and adjusted effects can be the reverse of each other. In other words, the apparent relationship between X and Y may change when accounting for Z. Note, however, that this effect is in fact not at all a paradox but the logical consequence of multivariate regression depending on the compound impact of different regressors.

The Swiss Data App visualizes this connection. It allows for playing around with different sets of output and regressor variables. 

The Swiss dataset is a data frame with 47 observations on 6 variables (each of which is in percent). The data come from each of the French-speaking provinces of Switzerland at about 1888.

The French speaking regions are located in the western part of Switzerland.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggswissmaps)

ch <- shp_df[["g1l15"]]
pr <- shp_df[["g1b15"]]
lk <- shp_df[["g1s15"]]
pr_rom <- subset(pr, BZNR %in% c(1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005, 1007, 2221, 2222, 2223, 2224, 2225, 2226, 2227, 2228, 2229, 2230, 2302, 2303, 2305, 2307, 2308, 2310, 2311, 2312, 2401, 2402, 2403, 2404, 2405, 2406, 2500, 2601, 2602, 2603, 241))

ggplot() + 
    geom_polygon(data = ch, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group), fill = NA, color = "grey") + 
    geom_polygon(data = pr_rom, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group), fill = "grey28", color = "grey") +
    geom_polygon(data = lk, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group), fill = "lightblue", color = "lightblue") +
    geom_path() +
    coord_equal() +
    theme_white_f() +
    ggtitle("French Speaking Provinces of Switzerland (2017)")
    
```

###Functionality
You can choose the y and two x variables from the six variables of the dataset

* Fertility: a common standardized fertility measure
* Agriculture: percent of males involved in agriculture as occupation
* Examination: percent draftees receiving highest on army examination
* Education: percent education beyond primary school for draftees
* Catholic: percent catholic (as opposed to protestant)
* Infant.Mortality: live births who live less than 1 year

The app renders two plots: one for the unadjusted effect and a residual plot adjusting both the y and the x1 variable by taking the residual after having regressed x2. This gives the correct relationship between x1 and y. 

Additionally, the app prints the summary of the full linear regression including all variables.
